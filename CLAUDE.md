# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is an Android app called "Nutry" built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app uses modern Android development practices including:
- Jetpack Compose for UI
- Material 3 design system
- Kotlin as the primary language
- Gradle with Kotlin DSL for build configuration

## Common Commands

### Build and Development
```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Clean build artifacts
./gradlew clean

# Install debug APK to connected device
./gradlew installDebug
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run instrumented tests (requires connected device/emulator)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests ExampleUnitTest

# Run specific instrumented test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest --tests ExampleInstrumentedTest
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Check for lint issues
./gradlew lint

# Generate lint report
./gradlew lintDebug
```

## Architecture

### Package Structure
- `com.example.nutry` - Main application package
- `com.example.nutry.data` - Database entities, DAOs, repositories, and converters
- `com.example.nutry.ui.theme` - Theme and styling components
- `com.example.nutry.ui.navigation` - Navigation components and routing
- `com.example.nutry.ui.screens` - Screen composables (ingredients, dishes, track, recommendations, settings)
- `com.example.nutry.ui.components` - Reusable UI components
- `com.example.nutry.ui.viewmodels` - ViewModels for business logic

### Key Components
- `MainActivity.kt` - Main activity with navigation setup

- `ui/theme/Theme.kt` - Material 3 theme configuration with dynamic color support
- `ui/theme/Color.kt` - Color definitions
- `ui/theme/Type.kt` - Typography definitions
- `data/NutryDatabase.kt` - Room database configuration
- `ui/navigation/BottomNavigation.kt` - Bottom navigation bar component

### Database Schema
- **Categories** - Food categories with emojis
- **Ingredients** - Individual ingredients linked to categories
- **Dishes** - Recipes/dishes with emojis
- **DishIngredients** - Many-to-many relationship between dishes and ingredients
- **TrackEntries** - Consumption tracking for dishes/ingredients
- **Settings** - App configuration (timewindows for freshness calculation)

### Build Configuration
- Uses Gradle version catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`) for dependency management
- Targets Android SDK 36 with minimum SDK 26
- Java 11 compatibility
- Compose BOM for consistent Compose library versions
- Room database with KSP for code generation
- Navigation Compose for screen navigation

### Testing Setup
- JUnit 4 for unit tests
- Espresso for UI tests
- Compose UI testing support included
